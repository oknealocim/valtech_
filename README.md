QA exercise
==============================

Overview

It took me more time as expected because we have release on project where i work right now

Getting started
---------------
- To be Able to rung tests you must have last version of Maven installed
- If it's not installed please follow instructions of how to do it from https://maven.apache.org/install.html

How to run project 
-----------
1. Pull code to your local machine
2. Open console on your machine
3. In console move to folder with project 
4. Execute command in console  "mvn test"



Exercise #1
-----------
- In my framework i use Java/Selenium/Selenide framework and Page object model. I use Factory methods from Selenide but also i know Selenium @FindBy methods i just didn't use them 
- I use WebDriverManager to automatically download and set webdriver 
  
Exercise #2
-----------
In this exercise i decided to write it like this without dividing it for couple tests and preset tests 
But i know other ways how i could handle this. I can explain it during interview.

Exercise #3
-----------
